# Correlation_covariance_tutorial
I created PYTHON INTERACTIVE NOTEBOOK in google colaboratory that WORKS WITHOUT INSTALLATION OR CONFIGURATION.

I used it in CORRELATION AND COVARIANCE tutorial video:  
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTWq4YUs93Y  
In my aproach I focused on gaining better intuition of what value of correaltion actually means on the graph and what you should be carefoul about when visually estimating.
I didn't only present formulas, but also explained why are they look the way they do, and why are they "working".
I also shared the tools in the link below, where you can "play" with the graph. Adjust different parameters and see how the correlation change. You will have a lot of optional accessories that help you to see it in the right way.
There is also a Game attached, where you can guess the correlation on the graph and compare it with actual correlation value showed with all the visual accessories.

I know that i didn't cover absolutelly everything about correlation but i didn't want the video to be to long.
I would be very thankfull if you would share your thoughts and constructive criticism about this video.
